static = known expecially fixed statically to the compile unit!!!



C++: static class member

NB: static class members have a DECLARATION in the header file, and
will need a DEFINITION separately in the .cpp file. If not, the code
will compile, but the linker will claim about missing symbol
definitions

in foo.hpp
    class Foo
    {
      ...
      private:
        static int my_member_;
      ...
      void some_func();
    };

in foo.cpp
    ...
    int Foo::my_member_;
    ...
    void
    Foo::some_func()
    {
        ...
        Foo::my_member_ = 123;
        ...
    }
