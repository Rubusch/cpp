STL and operators

- when working with names of films e.g. work with IDs because names can vary!!!

- a vector<T> knows it's size, an array don't

- for vector<T> appending items is cheap

- for list<T> inserting items is cheap

- list<T> does not provide the operator[], use const_iterator<T>

- The STL works with operator<() for the sort() function
and operator==() for the find() function.

- sort() and binary_search() don't work on list<T> but on vector<T>

- access elements per iterator use rather (*it).element than it->element
