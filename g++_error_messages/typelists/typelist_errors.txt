Typelist



Error: TypeAt

the typelist initially had only 3 elements it was reduced by 1
using TypeAt we tried an index higher than the last in the list

g++ -c -g -Wall typelist.cpp
typelist.cpp: In instantiation of ‘TL::TypeAt<Typelist_<short unsigned int, NullType>, 1u>’:

Error: NoDuplicates

we ran Replace on MyTypelist and got a list that probably contains duplicates:
MyReplacedTypelist, running NoDuplicates seems to not remove the duplicates.

problem: we ran NoDuplicates< MyTypelist > but have to apply it on
MyReplacedTypelist



Error: non-literal type ‘Classname’ in ‘constexpr’ function

make every funktion in the class "Classname" prefixed with the word "constexpr",
in some cases this won't compile, e.g. when complex types such as "string" are
used inside functions, then the class cannot be made "non-literal" easily
