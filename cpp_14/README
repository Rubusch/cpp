* Another alternative for type inference which will allow you to use decltype
  inference rules for auto variables.
* Aggregate initialization will work for classes with in-class member
  initializers.
* Built-in binary literals prefixed with 0b.

* Another standard attribute called [[deprecated]] will be added with the
  purpose of marking deprecated parts of the code. [/list]
