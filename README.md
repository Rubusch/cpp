## CONTENT

Assorted code snippets, notes from the net ranging from "what is a pointer?" to
how to template arithmetics mostly classic C++0x.

The start of this notes was probably in the early 2000s, there was never a major
cleanup.


## BUILD

If no separate README is contained, on  LINUX  open a shell and go to the
specific source, compile snippets using make, and run the *.exe file.

```bash
$ make
$ ./*.exe
```

``.exe`` is not used on Linux? I understand. Tell me more..
